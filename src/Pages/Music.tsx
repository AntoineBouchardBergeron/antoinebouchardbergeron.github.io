            <Trans>I wrote, recorded, mixed all of this track by myself, pretty much self taugth, if you don't count the occassionnal youtube video. I wanted to record this because I was going on a trip and I used to play this little tune to my child every day! </Trans>

            <Trans>I made this while at my last year of uni, it was for a class in unreal engine and this was the menu song. I recorded a two more songs and with multiple track to layer and plug and play as a beat maker loop.</Trans>

            <Trans>I made this a while ago, I ripped off some chords of a song and used the same as a beat, to motivate myself to study for an exam, but I ended up playing the bass and jamming on this pretty much all night.</Trans>

            <Trans>This was recorded in coldsun drummer's basement. We have since improved the song quite a bit and mostly, are more at ease playing it. Also, you can totally hear the change to 7/4 and how incomfortable it made me while singing.<br/><br/>
